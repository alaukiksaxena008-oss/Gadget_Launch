    <h1>DRONE</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), are unmanned aircraft that are remotely controlled or fly autonomously using onboard software and sensors like GPS, radar, and high-resolution cameras. They are used in various fields for purposes including military operations, agriculture, filmmaking, search and rescue, and delivery services. Drones range from hobbyist models to advanced military and delivery drones, and their increasing complexity is often attributed to integrated Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. </p>

    <h3>COMPONENTS</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Drones are equipped with -</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Flight Controller</li>
        <li>Battery</li>
        <li>Motors</li>
        <li>Propellers</li> 
        <li>Sensors</li>
        <li>Antennas for Communication</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>NAVIGATION</h3><!--Now explaining the uses of drone in real life-->
    <hr>
    <p>They use GPS for navigation and can recieve commands from a remote control or an app. Drones navigate by processing data from onboard sensors, with Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), like GPS, providing absolute location and altitude. They use flight controllers to adjust motor speeds, follow pre-set waypoints, and maintain position. For indoor or GPS-denied environments, drones use computer vision, LiDAR, or ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles and map surroundings for safe, autonomous flight.</p>
    <h3>SMART FEATURES</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Advanced drones can detect and avoid obstacles, automatically return to their takeoff point if the battery is low or connection is lost, and are programmed to avoid restricted airspaces like those near airports. </p>

    <h3>TRENDS OF PRICE OF DRONE</h3><!--Things about price of drone,decrease in the price of drone-->
    <hr>
    <p>Generally, drone prices have decreased over time due to technological advancements and increased competition, making them more accessible to consumers. However, high-end, feature-rich "prosumer" drones with 4K cameras and advanced sensors still command a higher price than basic models.</p>
